# Privacy-Policy

This is page is used to inform visitors regarding the policies related to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decided to use this service.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using this service, you may be required to provide certain information, up to and including an email address. The information that is requested will be stored on the server and is retained for use as described in this privacy policy.

This web application uses Auth0 for third party identification via Google, in which case your Google account username and email address will be collected.

An email address is used to verify an account, and from then on, the user can access their saved schedules and reviews by logging into this account via their email address. Without collecting an email address, it is impossible to have an account on this web application, and therefore many of the services offered will not be available to those who do not utilize an email address.

This web application will only utilize this email to store your account data, and to verify that your email exists via a verification email. This is the extent to which this web application will use any personal information. The only personal who has access to this information is the manager and creator of the web application, Aiden Duffy.

In the event of a takeover or dissolution, all data records containing user information are to be purged. There will be no transfer of data containg possible personal information if such an event occurs.

## Security

However, it must be remembered that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and reliable, and therefore absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Therefore, any users are advised to review this information periodically for any changes. The web application will have notifications to display to users any changes that are made to this Privacy Policy.

This policy is effective as of 2020-11-22.
